About this project:
3 months and half into the internship, this is the second game that I've created. It contains options for custom tower height, a save and load system for a default file location and a save and load system where you choose your directory via file explorer.
Each player has his own account (with username and password) so overriding and loading files from the other accounts via the file explorer is denied.
