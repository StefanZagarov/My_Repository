4 months into the internship, this is the first project I've been assigned by the company I was working for at the time.
This project contains two methods that when used will create a window containing a message written by the user of the code, or an error window containing a message and a stack trace info. When a message is displayed it is then saved in a history log panel from where you can see the history of what messages have been displayed aswell as the option to open a window showing the full message.
